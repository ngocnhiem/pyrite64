> [!CAUTION]
> **This Project is still not ready for general use!**<br>
> The source code has been released since it was used and largely developed for a gamejam.<br>
> However, the process of setting up the editor and support for windows/macos is still WIP.<br>
> Documentation is also missing.

Once that is done, a proper release will be made.<br>
Sorry!
