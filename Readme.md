Pyrite64 is a visual editor + runtime-engine to create 3D games that can run on a real N64 console or accurate emulators.<br>
Besides the usual editor, some extra features include:
- Automatic toolchain installation on Windows
- 3D-Model import (GLTF) from blender with [fast64](https://github.com/Fast-64/fast64) material support.
- Support for HDR+Bloom rendering (shown here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP8g2ngHftY)
- Support for big-texture rendering (256x256) (shown here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNEo0aQkGnU)
- Runtime engine handling scene-management, rendering, collision, audio and more.
- Global asset management with automatic memory cleanup
- Node-Graph editor to script basic control flow

Note that this project focuses on real hardware, so accurate emulation is required to run/test games on PC.<br>
Emulators that are accurate enough include [Ares](https://ares-emu.net/) and [gopher64](https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64).
